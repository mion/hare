# GOAL
A fun and practical project to learn AI.

I am implementing a game/simulation of the real world using creatures in a
Tibia-like environment. You can talk to creatures, command them, ask things,
etc. They should behave like approximately like humans and ultimately show
human-like behavior.

## Entities

Here are the entities and what they do in the simulation.

Creatures
- occupy one square meter on the grid
- can be carried
- have weight
- have sight
- have basic emotions: anger, sadness, fear, etc.
- understand and speak natural language with each other
- ...
Objects
- can be carried
- can be dropped on the floor
- have weight
- ...
Ground
- can hold creatures
- can hold objects
